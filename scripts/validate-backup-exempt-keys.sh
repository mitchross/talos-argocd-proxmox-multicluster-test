# Guard against the pvc-plumber backup-exempt contract drifting.
#
# Why this exists:
#   The pvc-plumber v4 contract for exempting a PVC from backup is the
#   label `backup-exempt: "true"` PLUS the fully-qualified annotation
#   `storage.vanillax.dev/backup-exempt-reason`. The bare key
#   `backup-exempt-reason` is NOT recognized by the operator's label
#   parser — it classifies the PVC as ExemptMissingReason, which lands
#   in /audit as `needs-human-review` and (in any future strict mode)
#   would be denied at admission. v4.0.1 is a permissive reconciler with
#   no admission webhook, so in production the bare key surfaces only as
#   audit noise that masks real findings — exactly what happened on
#   2026-06-09, when two prometheus-stack PVCs sat in needs-human-review
#   because their exemption reasons used the bare key inside Helm values.
#   This script makes the contract violation fail in CI instead.
#
# Exit 1 if any manifest has `backup-exempt: "true"` but is missing the
# fully-qualified `storage.vanillax.dev/backup-exempt-reason` annotation
# (including the case where only the bare key is present).
