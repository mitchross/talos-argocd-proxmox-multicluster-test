# Database Guidelines (CNPG CloudNativePG)

> **Required reading before performing DR or modifying database backups:**
> - [`docs/domains/cnpg/disaster-recovery.md`](../../docs/domains/cnpg/disaster-recovery.md) — canonical DR runbook, overlay pattern, troubleshooting

Databases use **CloudNativePG** with Barman backups to RustFS S3 — a **separate backup path** from the PVC/VolSync system.

- **Normal application PVC backups**: Kopia via VolSync, wired by pvc-plumber
  v4.0.1 on Talos
- **Database backups**: Barman to S3 (SQL-aware base backup + WAL archiving for PITR)

See [`docs/volsync-storage-recovery.md`](../../docs/volsync-storage-recovery.md#why-two-backup-systems-pvcs-vs-databases) for why both exist.

## Repo layout per DB

Each CNPG DB uses a Kustomize **overlay pattern** where the active bootstrap
mode is a one-line feature flag in git.

```
manifests/database/cloudnative-pg/<db>/
├── kustomization.yaml              ← FEATURE FLAG — picks one overlay
├── externalsecret.yaml             ← 1Password-backed app credentials
├── scheduled-backup.yaml           ← daily Barman ScheduledBackup
├── base/
│   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   └── cluster.yaml                ← no bootstrap; serverName = current write target
└── overlays/
    ├── initdb/
    │   ├── kustomization.yaml
    │   └── bootstrap-patch.yaml    ← merge-patch adds bootstrap.initdb
    └── recovery/
        ├── kustomization.yaml
        └── bootstrap-patch.yaml    ← merge-patch adds bootstrap.recovery + externalClusters
```

The root `kustomization.yaml`:

```yaml
resources:
  - overlays/initdb           # ← normal operation (fresh DB or already-running)
  # - overlays/recovery       # ← flip here for disaster recovery
  - externalsecret.yaml
  - scheduled-backup.yaml
```

**Why overlays instead of editing `cluster.yaml` in place:**
- `bootstrap.initdb` and `bootstrap.recovery` are mutually exclusive at the
  CRD level. Keeping only ONE active in the rendered manifest avoids the
  CNPG webhook rejection.
- Feature flag (one commented line) is a clean git diff. Easy to review.
- No need for `cnpg.io/validation: disabled` annotation.

## Current lineage per DB

The `serverName` values below live in each DB's `base/cluster.yaml` and
`overlays/recovery/bootstrap-patch.yaml` — bump both when you recover.

| Database  | Current write target (base)  | Prior lineage (recovery source) |
|-----------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| gitea     | `gitea-database-v6`          | `gitea-database-v5`             |
| immich    | `immich-database-v4`         | `immich-database-v3`            |
| paperless | `paperless-database-v4`      | `paperless-database-v3`         |
| temporal  | `temporal-database-v6`       | `temporal-database-v5`          |

All four bumped TWICE on 2026-06-11: once for the Longhorn V2 rebuild
nuke, and again for the same-day re-nuke (SPDK cpu-mask validation run)
because the aborted first attempt dirtied the fresh prefixes (immich and
paperless archived WALs before the SPDK wedge stalled the rebuild).
Fresh initdb on clean prefixes keeps the WAL-archive empty check passing.
The prior lineages exist on RustFS but are
**unrestorable** until the RustFS multipart bug is fixed — all Barman base
backups upload multipart and RustFS cannot serve multipart objects
("encrypted object metadata is incomplete"). DB DR via Barman is therefore
non-functional cluster-wide; treat DB data as disposable until RustFS is
fixed or backups are rerouted. History: all DBs reset to `-v1` on
2026-04-19 (S3 wipe); gitea `-v2` 2026-05-02 (GPU node loss, real Barman
restore); gitea/temporal `-v3` opened around the 2026-06-02 first nuke.

## Normal operation (add a new CNPG DB)

1. Copy an existing DB directory (e.g. `gitea/`) to `<newapp>/`.
2. Update names, owner, image, postInitApplicationSQL, resource sizes in `base/cluster.yaml` and `overlays/initdb/bootstrap-patch.yaml`.
3. Set `base/cluster.yaml` `backup.barmanObjectStore.serverName` to `<newapp>-database-v1`.
4. Set `overlays/recovery/bootstrap-patch.yaml` to reference `<newapp>-database-v1` as the prior lineage (placeholder until a real DR event bumps both).
5. Add or update the Talos deploy target under
   `clusters/talos/database/cloudnative-pg/<db>/`, including its
   `.argocd/config.json`.
6. Commit + push. The database AppSet discovers
   `clusters/talos/database/*/*/.argocd/config.json`.

## Disaster recovery (bump lineage + flip to recovery)

See the full runbook in [`docs/domains/cnpg/disaster-recovery.md`](../../docs/domains/cnpg/disaster-recovery.md#runbook-restore-from-barman-recovery). Short version:

1. Bump `base/cluster.yaml` `serverName` to next `-vN`.
2. Set `overlays/recovery/bootstrap-patch.yaml` `externalClusters.serverName` to the now-prior `-v(N-1)`.
3. Flip root `kustomization.yaml` → `overlays/recovery`.
4. Commit, push.
5. Delete live Cluster + PVCs so CNPG re-evaluates bootstrap on fresh creation:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n cloudnative-pg delete cluster <db>-database
   kubectl -n cloudnative-pg delete pvc -l cnpg.io/cluster=<db>-database
   ```
6. Trigger ArgoCD sync on the `<db>` application.
7. Watch `*-full-recovery-*` pod logs for Barman base + WAL replay.

## Critical rules (from prior incidents)

- **Never set `recoveryTarget.targetTime` beyond the last archived WAL.**
  Postgres FATALs with "recovery ended before configured recovery target was reached." If uncertain, omit the target entirely to restore to latest-WAL.
- **Always delete PVCs after deleting the Cluster.** CNPG leaves them as
  data protection. Stale PVCs cause the new Cluster to hang "Setting up primary" forever.
- **Keep `.spec.bootstrap` and `.spec.externalClusters` OUT of the database
  AppSet's `ignoreDifferences`.** `RespectIgnoreDifferences=true` + SSA will
  silently strip those fields during apply, producing a Cluster with no
  bootstrap → CNPG defaults to initdb → empty DB despite git saying recovery.
- **Rolling-restart consumer apps after a DB rebuild.** Pods connected to the
  old DB won't re-run their migrations against the new empty one until restarted.
- **Specify `database` + `owner` + `secret` in recovery bootstrap.** CNPG
  defaults to `database: app, owner: app` if omitted.
- **Don't add CNPG PVCs to pvc-plumber/VolSync backup labels.** They use
  Barman, not Kopia.

## Deprecation warnings

- **Native `spec.backup.barmanObjectStore`** — will be removed in CNPG 1.30.0.
  Migrate to the Barman Cloud Plugin (already installed at
  `manifests/database/cnpg-barman-plugin/`). Not urgent; track release notes.
- **`spec.monitoring.enablePodMonitor`** — deprecated, replace with manually-
  managed `PodMonitor` resources per cluster.

## Monitoring

Use `kubectl cnpg status <cluster>` CLI plugin for best single-view health.
See [`docs/domains/cnpg/disaster-recovery.md` § Monitoring & Tools](../../docs/domains/cnpg/disaster-recovery.md#monitoring--tools) for Grafana dashboards, Headlamp, K8sGPT, and a copy-paste state-check script.
